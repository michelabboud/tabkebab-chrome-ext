  TabKebab — Chrome Web Store Listing
============================================================

EXTENSION NAME:
TabKebab

SHORT DESCRIPTION (132 chars max):
Stack and organize your tabs — group by domain or AI, stash and restore, save sessions, close duplicates, sleep idle tabs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
TabKebab is a side panel extension that tames tab chaos. Group, stash, sleep, and restore tabs across windows — manually or with AI.

🗂 ORGANIZE
• Group tabs by domain into native Chrome tab groups with one click
• AI-powered smart grouping that understands context (research, shopping, work)
• Drag-and-drop custom groups with color coding
• Consolidate scattered windows into fewer, organized ones

📦 STASH
• Save and close tabs by window, Chrome group, or domain
• Tabs are offloaded to local IndexedDB — no cloud, no size limits
• Restore later in discarded mode so tabs don't all load at once
• Favicon previews, source badges, and one-click restore or delete

💾 SESSIONS
• Save full snapshots of every window, tab, and group layout
• Restore with automatic deduplication — already-open tabs are skipped
• Auto-saves on browser start and every 24 hours, keeping the last 2
• Per-session export for sharing or backup

😴 TAB SLEEP (KEBAB)
• Discard tabs to free memory while keeping them in the tab strip
• Per-domain keep-awake exceptions (email, calendars, AI tools protected by default)
• AI-assisted classification suggests which domains to protect
• Sleep by domain, group, window, or everything at once

🔍 FIND & CLEAN
• Duplicate detection and bulk close across all windows
• Natural language commands: "close YouTube tabs", "find my GitHub tabs", "group by project"

📤 EXPORT & SYNC
• Full JSON export/import of sessions, stashes, groups, and settings
• Individual session and stash exports
• Google Drive sync (optional)

🤖 AI PROVIDERS (all optional, bring your own key)
• OpenAI (GPT-4.1, GPT-5, o4-mini)
• Anthropic Claude (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
• Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro, 3.0 preview)
• Chrome Built-in AI (Gemini Nano, on-device, no API key needed)
• Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, Groq, Together AI)

🔒 PRIVACY
• Zero data collection — no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking
• Everything stored locally unless you explicitly opt in to AI or Drive
• API keys encrypted with AES-GCM 256-bit
• Full privacy policy: https://github.com/michelabboud/tabkebab-chrome-ext/blob/main/PRIVACY.md
