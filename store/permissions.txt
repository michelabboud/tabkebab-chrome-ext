  TabKebab — Permission Justifications
============================================================

When submitting to the Chrome Web Store, you'll need to justify
each permission. Copy-paste these into the relevant fields.

------------------------------------------------------------

PERMISSION: tabs
JUSTIFICATION:
Required to read tab information (URL, title, favicon, pinned state, active status) for core functionality: grouping tabs by domain, detecting duplicates, saving/restoring sessions, stashing tabs, and displaying tab lists in the side panel. No tab content is read — only metadata.

PERMISSION: tabGroups
JUSTIFICATION:
Required to create, update, and query Chrome native tab groups. This is core functionality — the extension organizes tabs into color-coded groups by domain, AI suggestion, or user-defined rules.

PERMISSION: storage
JUSTIFICATION:
Required to persist user data locally: saved sessions, custom tab groups, keep-awake domain lists, AI provider settings, encrypted API keys, and cached AI responses. All data stays on the user's device.

PERMISSION: sidePanel
JUSTIFICATION:
The extension's entire UI is a Chrome side panel. This permission is required to register and open the side panel where users interact with all features.

PERMISSION: identity
JUSTIFICATION:
Required for optional Google Drive sync. Users who choose to connect Google Drive authenticate via chrome.identity to get an OAuth2 token with drive.file scope. The extension creates a visible "TabKebab" folder in the user's Drive and can only access files it created — never any other file. This feature is entirely opt-in and the permission is not used unless the user explicitly enables Drive sync.

PERMISSION: alarms
JUSTIFICATION:
Required for the auto-save feature that creates a session backup every 24 hours. A single recurring alarm triggers the auto-save function. No other alarms are used.

HOST PERMISSION: https://api.openai.com/*
JUSTIFICATION:
Required for optional AI-powered features (smart tab grouping, natural language commands, keep-awake classification) when the user chooses OpenAI as their AI provider. No requests are made unless the user configures an API key and initiates an AI action.

HOST PERMISSION: https://api.anthropic.com/*
JUSTIFICATION:
Required for optional AI-powered features when the user chooses Anthropic Claude as their AI provider. No requests are made unless the user configures an API key and initiates an AI action.

HOST PERMISSION: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*
JUSTIFICATION:
Required for optional AI-powered features when the user chooses Google Gemini as their AI provider. No requests are made unless the user configures an API key and initiates an AI action.
