  TabKebab — Privacy Policy (for Chrome Web Store)
============================================================

Paste this into the "Privacy practices" section of your
Chrome Web Store listing. Also link to the full policy:

------------------------------------------------------------

TabKebab collects zero data. No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking, no cookies, no fingerprinting — nothing. We have no servers and no backend infrastructure.

DATA STORED LOCALLY:
All extension data lives inside your browser profile:
• Sessions (window/tab snapshots) — chrome.storage.local
• Custom tab groups — chrome.storage.local
• Keep-awake domain list — chrome.storage.local
• AI settings and encrypted API keys — chrome.storage.local
• Stashed tabs — IndexedDB (TabKebabStash)
• Decrypted API keys (temporary) — chrome.storage.session (wiped on restart)

API keys are encrypted with AES-GCM 256-bit using PBKDF2 key derivation. Plaintext keys are never written to disk.

DATA THAT LEAVES YOUR DEVICE:
• AI providers (opt-in only): If you enable AI features and provide an API key, tab titles and URLs are sent to your chosen provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or a custom endpoint). Chrome Built-in AI runs entirely on-device.
• Google Drive sync (opt-in only): If you connect Google Drive, sessions, stashes, and groups are stored in a visible "TabKebab" folder on your Drive. The extension can only access files it created. Works across multiple computers.
• Export files: JSON files downloaded to your computer when you choose to export.

No data is sent anywhere else. There is no analytics endpoint, error reporting service, or update mechanism that contacts any server.

SINGLE PURPOSE:
TabKebab's single purpose is browser tab organization and management.
